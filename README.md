# Calculator-using-HTML-CSS-JS
,We've created a basic HTML structure with a calculator interface. We have a text input element to display the calculator's output and a set of buttons for digits, operators, and other functions.

Next, let's add some basic CSS styles to make it look visually appealing. Create a file named "style.css"

Finally, let's implement the calculator's functionality using JavaScript. Create a file named "script.js"

This JavaScript code defines functions to handle button clicks and update the calculator's display accordingly. The appendInput function is called whenever a digit or operator button is clicked, and it adds the corresponding value to the currentInput variable. The clearScreen function clears the input, and the calculate function evaluates the expression and displays the result. The updateScreen function updates the calculator's display with the current input.

With these three files (index.html, style.css, and script.js) in the same directory, you should have a functional calculator when you open the HTML file in your web browser.
